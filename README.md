# Azure Data Services Go Fast Codebase

## Introduction

The Azure Data Services Go Fast Codebase is a combination of Microsoft components designed to shorten the "time to value" when deploying an Azure Data Platform. Key features include:

- Infrastructure as code (IAC) deployment of MVP Azure Data Platform 
- "Out of the box" Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment framework  
- Enterprise grade security and monitoring with full support for Key Vault, VNETS, Private Endpoints and Managed Service Identities
- Codeless Ingestion from commonly used enterprise source systems into an enterprise data lake
- Users can interact with capabilities through a webpage and embedded dashboards.

This project is composed of Microsoft components and Open-Source Software (OSS) and is provided to customers and partners at no charge. 

At its core this project is intended to be an accelerator. As such, it is designed to accelerate the “time to value” in using the Microsoft components. As an accelerator, is it not for sale, nor is it a supported product.

## Getting Started

Getting started is always the hardest part of any process so to help clients & partners get started with this repository we provide a set of online, on-boarding and upskilling workshops. Spaces in these workshops are limited and subject to an application process. If you are interested then please 
nominate yourself at [https://forms.office.com/r/qbQrU6jFsj](https://forms.office.com/r/qbQrU6jFsj).
  

### Prerequisites

Deployment of this project requires a variety of services across Azure. Please ensure that you have access to these services before continuing on to the deployment section of this guide.

>To get started you will need the following:
>
>- An active Azure Subscription & Empty Resource Group*
>- Owner rights on the Azure Resource Group
>- Power BI Workspace (Optional)

*Note that for a fully functioning deployment the deployment process will create a Deployment Service principal and two Azure Application Registrations within the Azure Active Directory (AAD) domain that is connected to your Azure subscription. It is recommended that you use an Azure subscription and AAD on which you have the necessary privileges to perform these operations. 

You can sign up for an Azure subscription [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) 

Once you have your Prerequisite items, please move on to the Deployment Configuration step.

## Deployment Configuration

You will also need some development tools to edit and run the deployment scripts provided. It is recommended you use the following:
>
>- A windows based computer (local or cloud)
>- [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
>- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
>- [Windows Store Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N9TNGVNDL3Q)

The deployment uses a concept of **Developing inside a Container** to containerize all the necessary pre-requisite components without requiring them to be installed on the local machine. Follow our [Configuring your System for Development Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) guide.

Once you have set up these pre-requisites you will then need to [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.1/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository to your local machine. 

:triangular_flag_on_post: If you want a stable deployment it is highly recommended that you checkout one of the official release tags. For example, if you wish to deploy v1.0.2 run the line below from within the directory into which you cloned the repository.

```bash 
git checkout tags/v1.0.2
```

## Deployment
To deploy the solution open **Visual Studio Code** and carry out the following steps.

>- :white_check_mark: From the menu select "File" then "Open Folder". Navigate the directory into which you cloned the solution. It should look like the image below with a ".devcontainer" folder at the root. Open this folder in Visual Studio Code.

>- :white_check_mark: Next, from the Visual Studio Code menu, select "View", "Command Palette". When the search box opens type "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container". **Note** that Docker Desktop needs to be running before you perform this step. 
>- :white_check_mark: From the menu select "Terminal", "New Terminal". A new Powershell Core window will open at the bottom of your screen. You are now running within the Docker container.
>- :white_check_mark: You are now in the development and deployment environment. Within the new terminal window navigate to the DeploymentV2 directory using the commands below:
``` pwsh
cd ./solution/DeploymentV2
```
>- :white_check_mark: You are now ready to begin the IAC deployment. To do so follow [this detailed guide.](./solution/DeploymentV2/README.md)
